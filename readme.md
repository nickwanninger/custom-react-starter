# React Starter
## How to?
Run this command to clone the repo to your local machine
~~~
git clone https://github.com/nickwanninger/custom-react-starter.git react-starter && cd react-starter && rm -rf .git/ && sudo npm install
~~~
Then run `npm start`. That will host the node server with nodemon on port 3000.

Thats it!

This is just the workflow I like the most but feel free to use it yourself
