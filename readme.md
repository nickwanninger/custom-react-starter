## How to?
Run this command to clone the repo to your local machine
~~~
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nickwanninger/bccdefb2eb60f3c29f1a1e579c49eb28/raw/a75250fb8d733dc60a81ffa562b90c528ba2297d/installReactStarter.sh | bash
~~~
Then run `npm start`. That will host the node server with nodemon on port 3000.

Thats it!

This is just the workflow I like the most but feel free to use it yourself
